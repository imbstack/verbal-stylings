<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center">***</p>
<p> </p><p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
									It wasn't going well. They just weren't getting the kind of volunteer force necessary to really put together a usable sample. Leonard was arguing for advertising in the tertiary townships that just barely edged onto university land. He'd wanted to spread out from day one, but LePonte just could not understand where he thought he was getting the funds. No number cruncher in the world would be able to pull that out of their tiny starting grant, but somehow Leonard was convinced that if they just set up outreach clinics in Maryland and - god forbid - West Virginia, the work would be saved. Which was probably true, really, but with just the two of them it was hardly even feasible for <span style="font-style:italic">one</span> clinic to take subjects.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	More subjects, more data, more proof. That was the mantra.</p> 
	 <p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Or, as it stood, few subjects. Some data.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	No proof.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Maybe we should try New York again,' Leonard said. His cowlick was at full attention. Beneath it, his pinched face had gone sallow weeks ago.</p> 
	 <p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Why? What's the point? We have nothing.' LePonte was tired, it made him snappish.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'But the center at NYU said -'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'It doesn't matter.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Silence filled up by the dripdripdrip on tin. Not an aggressive rain, but one with no sense of purpose. Outside, the ground would be just damp enough to stain their leather shoes.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'We don't have to set up clinics,' Leonard suggested. 'We could just travel in the area. Advertise on our own.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'We're not minstrels, Kilmer,' LePonte remarked with a pinch at the bridge of his nose. 'Besides. We need to bring them here. It's no good if they're not here. No readings, no evidence, no new review at NYU.' For a second he thought Kilmer might smile at the rhyme, and he thought that if that happened, he'd probably have to punch his teeth in.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'What about Bonnie Tedesco?' Leonard said instead. 'She's promising. Let's just focus on that.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Bonnie Tedesco is going home to her mommy in twenty-three hours,' LePonte reminded him. 'We're not going to last much longer without results.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'We have more time.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'We <span style="font-style:italic">don't</span>,' LePonte broke out, and brought a hand down on the tabletop with a smack. 'We are all out. Leo, this is it.'</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	They sat.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Everything was eggshell in the study. The carpet, the walls. It was supposed to be cleansing, to suggest space. It made LePonte feel as though he were sitting in a padded room banging his head against air. The space it suggested was smothering.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Leonard folded his arms. His bug-face contracted even tighter beneath his youthful swipe of hair, and there was quiet.</p> 
	<p> </p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	The typical dose of clozapine - their brand, anyway - was just enough to produce a mild sedative effect. Long-term use could induce tremors and low white blood cell counts, which had, in some patients, caused immune disorders and death; the drug had been recalled in the late '70s. The doctored dose Kilmer and LePonte were using was a mixture of a few more modern atypicals, designed to act as an antipsychotic that would (or could, they hoped) bring on a more productive seizure. This was not exactly what they were disclosing to their small batch of study subjects. </p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Bonnie Tedesco was thirteen. She had a retainer, and had carefully placed a yellow and red plaid backpack below her bed on the first evening. Inside, they had discovered over the course of the tests, she kept a teddy bear (never to be seen save on camera), a notebook, and an expensive pack of drawing pencils. </p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	Bonnie's mother was a nonentity. From the medical records Kilmer and LePonte had requested before accepting her as a trial subject, they knew that she'd gotten pregnant when she was seventeen. It was unclear as to whether she'd since died or - as Leonard had put it - done a runner. Her father worked in a veterinary clinic, though not as a doctor. It put him in an awkward financial position, which he'd taken several uncomfortable moments to explain to them when he brought his daughter to the clinic.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
LePonte had not admitted the pang of guilt he'd felt after that. He'd looked at Leonard, and when Leonard had not looked back, he'd understood that guilt was not something the two of them would discuss.</p> 
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
They gave the girl a double dosage at 11pm and waited. Ostensibly, the drug was supposed to positively affect her night terrors, to soothe her mind and cull away whatever it was that kept her up at night. She was also being given supplements to keep her white blood cells from depleting to a dangerous level. That was the surface of the study.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
The bedroom was dark. It was kept that way, to help the patients sleep. LePonte sat in a wicker chair he'd brought with him from his small apartment, a notebook on his lap, and watched. She was out, her breathing steady, the IV drip in her left arm an eery transparent glimmer against her skin. She snored slightly. It was oddly comforting, that gentle huff and release. LePonte knew that Kilmer was opposite the one-way glass to his right, and that their every move would be recorded on the two cameras mounted in respective corners of the room... but there was a stillness to it all that had the power to unnerve. Given enough time in a dark room watching someone else sleep, every breath becomes surreal.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
Exactly thirty-two minutes after administering the dose, the stillness changed. Not a sound but a movement of air, a vibration that skittered over LePonte's clean-shaven cheek like a thousand imagined insects. His eyes jumped from his lap to the bed, marking each wrinkle in the sheet. It took a moment to find the source of the shift, and when he did, LePonte felt his skin begin to crawl.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
It was nothing they hadn't seen before. A common side effect of most antipsychotics: tremors. Her hand, the one with the IV in it, was shaking. Not profoundly, but rather just enough to send the line into a series of soft undulations that rolled across the room in minute, near-indiscernible waves. It was a subtle thing, but LePonte hated it. The whole situation made him paranoid, but there was something grotesque about that silent jerking of the fingers; it looked unnatural and somehow threatening. The death rattle of a puppeteer unwilling to give up his toy.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
He glanced towards the mirror on the wall above the bed, and waved a hand. Two raps back. Kilmer was watching, too.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
LePonte bent to his notebook, squinting, and wrote down the time and the symptom. He was still peering at the yellow legal paper when Bonnie Tedesco started screaming.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
'Shit!' LePonte remarked, less loudly than expected, and dropped the pad. 'Leonard, get in here!'</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
'I have to monitor - '</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
'Shut the fuck up and get in here,' LePonte barked. The shock was over now, and he was trying to get his belt out of the goddamn loops because she was thrashing and her mouth was opening and closing, her tongue was in there somewhere but it might not be in a few seconds. Leonard burst in.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
'Fuck,' he said, and lunged onto the bed. 'Get her head!'</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	LePonte got the belt out and shoved it between Bonnie's jaws. The stuffy room was filled with new sounds, guttural punching cries, muffled by the belt but still so wet and loud they seemed to mirror LePonte's pounding heart. She was seizing hard, the IV swinging wildly. He managed to grab the tower before it toppled and ripped the needle right out of her vein, putting all of his weight on the girl's shoulders.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Her legs,' he grunted; Leonard promptly sat on Bonnie's thighs. </p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Jesus,' Leonard said, and that was when the equipment on the other side of the mirror started to explode.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Oh, what the <span style="font-style:italic">fuck</span>,' LePonte moaned, because Bonnie was still trying to tear herself up from the inside. </p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Straps,' Leonard reminded him. There was a series of quick popping noises from the other room: the lights? Something else cracked and splintered onto the floor, it sounded plastic. LePonte reached down, pinning her with half his torso, and got ahold of one of the leather straps that dangled from the borrowed hospital bed. By the time he'd gotten it up and put it along the line of her shoulders, it was all over.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	They secured her anyway. LePonte left the belt in her mouth. It seemed safer that way.</p> 
	The monitoring room was a wreck. The halogen lights that lined the ceiling were all shattered, bits of glass littering the floor and sticking in the grout. The TV was on the floor as well. It was still smoldering.</p> 
	 <p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'What the fuck,' LePonte said again. Leonard's face was shining.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	'Johnny,' he said. 'Johnny, we did it.' He took LePonte's hands and brought them to his face and kissed them. It was a moment of such rare intimacy that LePonte would remember it years later, when other things were shattered than glass.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	And when they went back into the study bedroom and realized that Bonnie Tedesco was dead, that moment would stay too.</p> 
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
	<p> </p>
	They closed up the clinic. It was impossible to do anything else. The grant went with it. So did their positions at Johns Hopkins. Leonard didn't seem to mind as much, but LePonte felt something leave him when he left the school.</p> 
	 <p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
They weren't living together when he got the call. For a few days immediately after the incident, LePonte had considered cutting off all contact with Leonard Kilmer. It felt good, thinking that. But it also felt cheap. Like bargaining, except so petty an act of contrition that it would almost make everything worse. And, in the end, there was the fact that Kilmer had been right.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
They had done it.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
It wouldn't get out. Their findings would never appear in weekly journals or be defended before the Board. But <span style="font-style:italic">they</span> knew.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">
And, as LePonte learned several weeks after his dismissal from the PhD program at Johns Hopkins, so did someone else.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">	The barn smelled of old hay, past rotten; the thick perfume of summer mixed with this polleny, cloying scent until the air itself seemed oppressed. Clary McRaven put out a hand and brushed her fingers along the rough pine wall. It was hard to see, the only light in the place coming in stumpy, blunt rectangles from three glassless windows. They'd been shuttered once, when she was younger, but time, addicts and bored teens had yanked the shutters off their hinges and left the windows unprotected. She was in the main room, a wide empty space that had been filled to bursting with hay bales from various local fields. Now, the cautious sunlight turned the floor dusky gold, and there was only ruined wheat strewn everywhere, a few crumpled cans, and a pile of shapeless rot. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary moved into the narrow hallway that led to the stalls, stalls which had never seen a horse. The office was further back, in the heart of the building, its door kicked in. She stepped over it, taking out the flashlight. Outside the afternoon sun may have been bright, but the office had no windows at all. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Her movements startled up clouds of dust, caught in the beam before they drifted back to settle along the caving floor and the surprisingly intact desk and chair. Papers were everywhere, most of them blank or faded with age. A few inexplicable glass jars, empty. A motheaten jacket in one corner, caked with what Clary thought was not plain mud, but rather dirt dobber hives. She kept her distance.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">It would be in the desk. That was the logical place. There had been no filing cabinet, she thought, or at least there wasn’t one anymore. Her heart thudding, Clary tiptoed to the desk as if someone were around to hear. She put the thin flashlight between her teeth, tongue avoiding its metallic tang, and began to sort through the papers stacked on top. There was a newspaper from September 23rd, 1984, and a pile of old computer paper, the kind with holes along each vertical edge. This was printed with what looked like accounting records, long lines of numbers and dates. Useless. Clary moved to the single desk drawer, checking beneath the handle for wasps before she pulled it open. The entire drawer came free with a little effort, and she smacked it onto the desk with none of her earlier care. She was close. She had to be.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The drawer was a mess of dried-out pens, a Bible, and manila folders covered in various shades of stain marks. Clary flipped each open and squinted, skimming: crop notes from the summer of 1990; a few newspaper clippings; a stack of postcards that any other time she would have read with fascination. She dropped the last folder, frustration turning in her belly. He'd promised her, sworn on his life! Of course, specificity was hard for his kind. As was honesty.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary spun, taking the flashlight from her teeth and scanning the rest of the little room. Maybe on the floor? She knelt and gathered the fallen papers in, avoiding the corner with the jacket, but it was just more of the same. By the time she'd checked the last sheet, Clary's hands were trembling. She felt sick, the old dumb dismay. Clary clenched both fists and breathed, trying to force her lungs to take in that heavy air. It smelled dead in here. Not like an animal, or old food, but <span style="font-style:italic">still</span>, still and dry. Mummified.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Her eyes fell on the Bible. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary got to her feet and reached for it. It was heavy, bound in thick leather and embossed with a name she didn't know. The lettering was fancy, though, and gold. It couldn't have been cheap. Clary lifted the cover, gently flipping through pages that were as thin as tissue paper. The printing was tiny, but she wasn't reading. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Halfway through, tucked neatly against the spine, she found it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary studied the small piece of paper with its spidery writing, blue ink fresh and dark as if it had been written just that morning. Then, she folded it and slipped it into her pocket. The Bible she returned to the drawer with a thunk, the drawer she slid back into place with a screech. She gave one final glance about the room. The office seemed no more disturbed than it had when she'd arrived, not that anyone would come looking. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Satisfied, Clary stepped back over the broken door and made her way to the barn entrance. She didn't want to stay inside a moment longer than necessary, not in this dark, deserted place. Clary remembered trips in her childhood, dares to go out to the hay barn in the middle of the night, whispered ghost stories with no basis in anything resembling fact. She hadn't cared then, about the truth; the shadowy, ramshackle building had been terrifying enough on its own. Now Clary had lost the fear, but not the discomfort. There was something unpleasant about abandoned places, something that squeezed at her insides. She felt it in the overgrown patches of her father’s crop fields, fallow for years.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">She shook it off in the sun, tucking the flashlight into the same pocket as her prize. Making her way through the meadow, Clary breathed in honeysuckle and cut grass. Midafternoon turned everything lush and welcoming, the land spreading out in a flashy July show. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Still, as Clary worked her fingers into her pocket and caught the paper, a nervy chill tugged at her elbows. She was always surprised when they were right.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">On the way home from that night's shift, Clary caught her own eye in a reflection. Her image was eerily sharp in Mudhouse Coffee's darkened window. The warped glass gave her cheeks a stretched, funhouse cast, turned each freckle to a scar. Clary checked for other faces out of habit, alert for any flickers of movement in the shadows at her back. Nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">She hurried from the alley shortcut to the comfort of yellowed streetlamps and a handful of college students making their way home from the Cavalier or Citizen Bar. It was just past two, and Water Street would soon be as empty as the cafe. Despite the caution, Clary loved this, this exact sliver of time in between rowdiness and silence. The old brick-lined street, once the town center, was beautiful in moonlight. Its quaint string of shops and restaurants and freshly closed bars seemed almost imagined, like lovingly rendered models of Historic Virginia. The UVA freshman vomiting into a planter was, Clary decided, the necessary contrast to make the rest of the picture perfect.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Her Volvo was the only car in the lot when she reached Staples, and a slip of notepad paper tucked under her wiper reminded her that the parking lot was not for anyone but Staples customers no matter how pretty any interloper might be. Clary rolled her eyes. No one had been towed from this lot in living memory, although the past summer's temporary monitor had left a vast swath of parking tickets in her wake. As far as Clary knew, no one had paid, and whoever it was that owned the Staples block (also home to a comic store and a flower stand) had apparently dropped back into oblivion. The parking monitor, wrathful but impotent, had gone back north to Fairfax where civilized folk lived and drove. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary ran her thumb over the initial dashed at the bottom of the note - a giant E that almost ran off the torn edge - and swung herself into the driver's seat. She crumpled the note and tossed it to the back. One day she’d have to have a talk with that boy. Today, though, had been too long and too complicated for anything other than bed. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">When she pulled into the gravel circle in front of her house, Clary was surprised to see the downstairs kitchen light on. She was subletting from a Danish couple who spent most of the year in New York, and the bottom half of the split level housed a middle-aged musician whose face was still more or less a mystery. She'd been in the house for almost two months now, and never once had a light been on post-closing shift. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Feeling the folded paper in her jeans pocket like a weight, Clary made her way up the three wooden steps and through the front door. She glanced at the door to #1 1650 Jefferson, immediately to the right of the staircase that led up to her own apartment. Thoughtlessly, Clary pressed her ear against the wood. There was no sound from the lower level, and embarrassment sent her jogging up to #2.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">	Clary woke to two texts and a voicemail from her mother. Her having not entirely grasped the fact that texts and voicemails accomplished more or less the same thing, all three were identical: Would she please come down for dinner one of these nights, because if she insisted on living in town, wasn't it the least she could do? Clary felt a twinge of guilt. Her parents had been so delighted to hear that she was moving back for the summer (and maybe a bit longer, up in the air, considering her options, you know). Convincing them that renting out the townhouse was a better idea than staying in her old bedroom hadn't been easy, not until she got the job at Mudhouse; not even McRaven Senior wanted his daughter driving alone down Route 20 at two in the morning. But she'd be lying if she said she wasn't taking advantage of the distance.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Still, dutifully, Clary gave her mother a call back and confirmed that she would be happy to come down to the farm for dinner that night, bottle of wine in hand. That done, she turned on the water and showered until her skin hurt.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Breakfast was eggs scrambled in butter and onions, fresh from the farmer's market. Clary toasted honey bread and ground five spoonfuls of Nat's hand-roasted coffee beans until the kitchen smelled just like morning. These moments of peace and quiet were rare, and she savored them.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"You found it, didn't you."" It wasn't a question. Clary didn't look up from her mug, lifting a bite of eggs and chewing for a long minute. "Don't ignore me!" She sighed.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"You know I did," Clary said. Behind her, the air hummed and cracked. "Now let me eat in peace."</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"But now you have to tell - "</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"I said," Clary repeated, turning in her chair, "let me eat." She glared at the empty air, eyes flicking towards the room's reflective surfaces. It shuddered into the curve of the silver tea kettle, wavered between the panes of her kitchen cabinets. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The dead thing huffed, disgusted.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"I'll get to you," Clary promised, and returned to her food. It was pushy, this scrape, impatient. The dead generally were. They had a different understanding of time, perpetually caught in their loops of urgency and threat. Clary had long since stopped trying to reason with their kind, although she didn't like to send them away. They never remembered being banished, always finding their way back with the same desperate certainties, and it made her tired.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">After she finished her breakfast, Clary went to the bedroom and found her discarded jeans from the day before. The paper was still there, folded practically into the pocket lining. She brought it into the kitchen and stretched her legs out at the table.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"It was where you said," she confirmed. The scrape hummed, coalescing into a pocket of static somewhere near the light fixture. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"You have to tell her," it said, excited. 
"That's everything."</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">	"You sure you don't want cops?" The light flickered, a spark cracking in the bulb. Clary glanced back at the kettle to catch a hint of teeth, the whites of an unfocused eye.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"No cops! Mona," the scrape insisted. "Tell Mona where."</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"All right, all right." Clary got to her feet. "I'll call her right now."</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Around her, the air shivered and giggled. It was happy, though it wouldn't hold onto the why for long. Clary reached for the wall phone and, eyes on the paper, dialed. After three rings, a woman picked up.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"Hello?"</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"Hi," Clary said. "Is this Mona?"</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"Who's calling?"</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">A shock of static zapped her cheek, and Clary bit her tongue.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"I have a message for you," she managed, eying the ceiling light warily. "Your husband left you something." There was silence at the other end. Clary had heard this silence before, and broke it quickly. "The dogwood in Seeley Park," she said, before Mona hung up. "Where he hurt his leg. It's buried there."</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"What - How..." Mona trailed off, shock warring with the pain. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">"I'm sorry for your loss. He loves you a lot, you should know that." Without waiting for another line of helpless questions, Clary put the phone back in its cradle. She turned to see the clearest version yet, dancing in the window above the sink: a man-shape of indeterminate age, dark-skinned, short hair. "She knows," Clary told it. "Just tell me it's not your body she's gonna dig -"</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">It was already gone.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Clary looked down at the paper in her hand. A phone number, a few scribbled details. She wasn't really worried about Mona finding a nastier surprise at the dogwood tree. Her husband's corpse was in the James River somewhere, or under the woods behind the hay barn. It was a popular spot to exchange certain goods because of the isolation that had made it so appealing to a ten year old, and whoever the scrape had been must have hidden this last message there not long before he died. What it had buried the scrape couldn't remember, nor why it'd been killed. Once, Clary would have been a slave to the mystery. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">She tossed the paper into the trash and sat back down to the rest of her coffee.</p>

							<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt"><em>I have nightmares about mouths.  This month's therapist is saying it has to do with my chronic lying; that's what I'm here for, after all.  Some subconscious guilt manifesting itself in big bad nightmares where I'm chased by those little fucking plastic jaws, you know, from gas stations, the ones that clack-clack-clack on your desk until your supervisor comes over and wrenches them apart so the springs snap all over the floor.  Gruesome.</em></p>
        	
<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">When I was little, my pop told me a story about teeth.  He said that when I lost a tooth and put it under my pillow, the tooth fairy came along and took it to sell to old people.  Imagine: all the little childteeth lined up on big black tables, so when you get old and your gums go barren, you can just... buy a new set.  Stick 'em in, work 'em around for a bit, make sure they get good and up there so they won't fall right back out again.  He was never clear on how the tooth fairy got paid, but when I heard this story, I thought of things that would be comparable to my teeth and decided that I probably didn't want to find out.  I was troubled by it all, even before it came true.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Fifteen years ago, I was ten.  I had a real prepubescent hard-on for a set of braces, because my friend Ray Giamatti had them and his were shiny and blue.  But my teeth, to my endless disappointment, were perfect.  Nothing like my pop's aging tombstones, which were chipped on the corners from - he claimed - opening beer bottles in his wild youth.  I asked him to demonstrate, but he grew quite prim about the matter and said his college days were over.  He always teased me about this, though, telling me that if I wanted to finally get those braces I'd better start working on some Buds.  I never did take him up on it.  My teeth are perfect to this day.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Anyway, back when I was ten, I was just about done shedding my baby chompers.  My real grown-up front teeth were in, and a bunch of the other ones, but there were two teeth way in the back that were getting real loose.  They were the last ones, and I was kind of hanging onto them.  I knew all the tricks for making loose teeth looser, but it was the end of an era and I wanted to draw it out if I could.  Also, it had been a good year or more since I'd lost the last few, and I didn't want to admit it to myself but I was a little concerned.  These were my last offerings to the Tooth Fair, after all.  What if the collector was, as Ray might say, 'pee-oh'd'?</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I didn't really think that fear through, though.  No reason for the tooth fairy to get annoyed that I didn't have any more to give up.  The world was full of little boys and girls just spitting old teeth all over the place, right?
        	So I had these two goners.  Pop knew about them, of course; my mama liked to make a big deal whenever I showed any signs of growing up and so as soon as she noticed me working my tongue at the back of my mouth at dinner, she started clapping her hands and smiling.  Her little boy, losing his last baby teeth.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Well, you know,' Pop said over his roast beef, 'I know an old lady at work who's gonna be just tickled pink to hear about that.  She's been waiting for another fang or two.'  Mama rolled her eyes, and he cut another chunk of meat. 'Can't eat anything but mashed cat food, poor old bat.'  When he said that I imagined an old lady waiting outside my bedroom window, rubbing her hands together like a cartoon villain.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">When the first tooth came out, I almost cried.  I didn't want to chuck it, because what if I ended up needing it in a few years?  But I was damn skippy sure I didn't want that tooth under my pillow.  I'd been fine with the tooth fairy before the story, and had happily traded my little baby teeth for quarters for years; now it was different.  Now there was some kind of threat to it, the sort of dread that comes from walking home after you see a scary movie and you know there isn't anything behind you but you walk just a little faster anyway because gosh, what if there is?  But what is a ten-year-old going to do with a tooth but stick it where his parents expect to find it in the middle of the night?</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Now, this next bit is the part where my therapists start perking up.  Everybody loves the stories of how we were traumatized as kids, but they love the early signs of schizophrenia even more.  I've done the pills and the shots and the bed rest.  Hell, I even started swearing up and down that it never happened, but come on, you know I've got that thing with the lying. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The night I lost the first tooth, I eventually decided that I was too big to be scared by a kid story.  Under the pillow it went, and when I went to sleep, it was with the covers all the way up to my chin.
        	When I woke up, at first I thought I'd had a nosebleed.</p>
  
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt"><em>I'm leaving the office now.  I have an appointment soon, and I don't want to be late.  I've promised Marcy - she wants me to call her just Marcy, says it takes away some of the awkwardness of talking to a shrink - to actually take the sleeping pills I'm not really keeping in the medicine cabinet.  I figure maybe someday I should let on that I never bought them to begin with, but I feel like that's really more of a third-date confession and I've only seen Marcy twice.</em> </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The car's out back.  I like to park in the lot of a minimart around the corner, so it looks like I've just come out of one of the other stores in the little strip mall instead of out of Dr. Bay's one-story office.  I've got enough connecting me with madness for now, I think.</p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">It wasn't a nosebleed. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Under my pillow, a tiny bit of rusty stain peeked out on the sheet.  Someone had left me a present.
        	When I saw them, at first I didn't understand.  I even poked the top nail, right where the quick stopped in a bloody curve.  Then, the knowledge of what exactly I was looking at came in a hard squeezing shock and I scrambled off the mattress.  I wanted to be screaming for Mama, or crawling under the sheets between my sleeping parents.  Instead, I stepped back up to the bed and looked at the fingernails.  There were three of them, full things, not just clippings. I didn't want to touch them or turn them over, but the morbid curiosity of childhood made my hand reach out to scoop them up.  In my palm they looked larger, and I remember doing one of those almost-puking things where you swallow it back down and then feel worse.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The worst part was, there was only one thing that this could mean.  Pop's story was true.  Maybe it hadn't always been true, because hadn't I gotten the nickels and dimes and quarters in the past?  But that didn't matter; it was true now and I didn't stop to think about any of the other stuff.  Something had come and taken my tooth and left me a little present, fair trade, and even a deal: three for one. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Now, when you're ten, you don't have the same kind of reasoning skills you might develop as a teenager or an adult.  You're a kind of unformed piece of energy, running high on emotion and low on practicality or strategic abilities.  And maybe it would have changed things if I'd just handled this a little bit differently, if I'd told my parents or even just thrown the nails away and waited for my last tooth to come out so I'd never have to look under my pillow again.  Then again, maybe not.  Sometimes things just happen on account of being divined or something, I guess.
        	Anyway, what I did in the end was to take those bloody fingernails and wrap them in one of the tissues by my bed.  I had it in my head that if I kept them safe and clean, maybe I could use them to trade back for my last tooth: maybe I could cut some kind of deal.  The shivery-scared part was mostly done with, because now I was determined to be brave and to live up to the stories I'd been reading about kids my age with magic powers who face down ultimate evil and come out on top.  </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">It wasn't hard to turn it into a game, really; the fear was still there, but if I could warp it with make-believe and give the whole situation a plot and a script to follow, it didn't seem so bad.  In fact... maybe it was kind of an adventure, you know?  Maybe it was my turn to be the hero in the storybook.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">And a week or two later, sure enough, out came that last back molar.  Mama and Pop and I celebrated by ordering out for pizza, which we usually only did on Friday nights sometimes when we got VHS tapes, and then I put the tooth in the same spot as before and got ready to stay awake.  These days, I use pills and those tiny energy drinks that they sell at the check-out line in grocery stores.  Back then, I used Coca Cola and nerves.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The window came up at around two, when the noises of my house had quieted down to nothing but the occasional creak of wood and my own too-noticeable breathing.  I was reading some of the comics Ray had let me borrow - Spiderman and a handful of other Marvel greats - with the little submarine-shaped flashlight I kept under my bed, but when I heard the soft, pressurized whoosh of the window sliding up I almost dropped both comic and flashlight.  When I swung the light around and aimed it at the window, I almost - more than almost - expected there to be nothing there. 
        	He was a smallish thing, shorter than Pop, with neat dark hair and a black turtleneck.  Standing right inside my room, knees bent just so, he stared at me and I stared back. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Are you the tooth fairy?' I asked, helpless against eyes that seemed opaque, refusing to reflect even some of the light I was shining at them.  He - it? - smiled, and I saw that his teeth were in the dozens, all needle-thin and pointy. Those gleamed where the eyes wouldn't; oh, my, did they gleam. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'I won't say no,' the tooth fairy told me.  His voice was butter-smooth and sly. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'I want to trade,' I said next.  He made an odd gesture with his hands, lifting them up to either side of his face and spreading the long fingers in some kind of surprise or theatrical alarm.  His fingers were too long, I saw then, and there was something wrong with the proportions of them; the longer I stared, the more everything seemed off.</p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'What for what, boychild?'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I grabbed the folded tissue with the three nails inside it and thrust it at him.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'I want to give these back and keep my last tooth.  I don't want any more fingernails.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The creature came forward and used those spindly fingers to unfold the tissue.  He moved with the kind of delicacy and care that I associated with old people or cats, each finger moving independently from the rest, never once touching my skin. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'My, my,' the tooth fairy said.  'These won't do at all.  They're used, you see.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'So's my tooth,' I argued.  Another smile.  The teeth glinted, and when he worked his jaw, they slid together without a sound. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Do you really want to make a trade?  You should be asleep for this, boychild.  You needn't pay any mind to what happens in the dark.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">At the question, I wavered.  He was right, of course.  I wasn't supposed to see any of this.  But the fingernails.  The fingernails, they had been left for me to find and how was anybody supposed to ignore that? </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Well, I don't want to,' was my argument.  'But I don't want these.  I don't like them.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'There are a lot of things I could show you that you wouldn't like,' he said silkily.  'And if you found the true trade... Well, then.  Yes.' He looked thoughtful, pale lines appearing between his thin black brows.  'Come with me, boychild, for the night.  Do that, and I promise, you'll never find fingernails under your pillow again.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The fact that he was - it seemed to me, in all my naivete - bargaining with me gave me a stupid sense of power.  Enough to reach under my pillow and pull out the tooth.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'This is my last one,' I said, with all the obstinacy of a child.  'You can't have any more after this.  I won't need to worry about it anyway.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Your last one?' he repeated, drawing out each word until it was taut and uneasy.  'Goodness.  There must have been some mistake.' The tooth fairy put the tips of his fingers together and tapped them once, twice, pensive and regretful.  'This house is scheduled for several more teeth, I'm afraid.  If you're all out, I suppose I'll have to look into... other options.' There was a long pause.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'That's not fair,' I said finally, and there it was, the pulse inside me, almost painful in my throat.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'It's really not, is it?' There was a sharpness to him now, and I could see it waiting to leap out at me.  'Let us try this, boychild, this... compromise.  You come with me now, and I will leave your home untouched.  Refuse...' He trailed off and slung a furtive glance towards my bedroom door.  Even at ten, I followed that black gaze all the way to my parents.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">It's funny, I don't really think of it as altruistic now.  It's hard to blame a child for being afraid, and for taking the path least likely to cause it pain.  It would be nice to call myself a real hero, doing what I did to save my parents from having their mouths torn open with a pair of neat silver pliers.  But I think I was really just scared shitless.</p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt"><em>The preschool lets out for the day in half an hour.  I have to be there early; there's a special circle for parents to pull up and wait for their kids and it fills up real fast.  This is one of those fancy preschools, the kind that has 'Prep' in the name, because they bring in foreign art teachers and teach every child how to play the piano before the recorder, so parents - or, more likely, babysitters - tend to be keen on showing one another up as more loving and more on top of things.  I've seen actual fights break out, people vying for the first spot in the circle.  I'll tell you one thing, my parents never would have put in for that crap. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I stop for gas and check the glove compartment.  The box is fine, of course; I'm not paranoid.  I take it out just to be sure, though, because it's always good to be sure.  It's an old cigar box I got at a garage sale a while back.  When I first started, I made do with a shoebox lined with paper towels.  But this one has a lock on it.  Locks are satisfying things no matter how you look at it.</em></p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">He took me out the window.  The details are blurry now, and it's not because of time.  Even the very next day, if you'd asked me to, say, draw a map of where I went that night, I would have just looked at you like I'd been hit with a brick as a toddler.  But I remember moving fast, on foot.  We lived in New York then, downtown, so 'through the window' meant 'down the fire escape,' which was a thing I was never allowed to do on my own.  But the tooth fairy got hold of my hand and then I moved faster, not because my own feet carried me but because somehow, when he touched me, it was like the things around us just slowed down.  Think stepping onto a moving sidewalk in the airport: you feel like you're going the same speed, but everything on either side just looks like it's been shoved into slow motion.  It was a good thing, too, because it was like that with the ground as well and I wasn't wearing shoes.
        	There were a couple times I thought we'd get stopped.  I'd never been out that late, and I was certain there would be police everywhere and that someone would notice a little boy being pulled around by this strange, dark man.  Oddly, I was more afraid in those surreal moments of being caught out by my parents and getting in trouble than of the tooth fairy himself.  Funny how fickle a child's mind can be. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">But we weren't stopped.  No one even gave us a second look.  Or a first look, for that matter.  All the people we did pass at two in the morning on a Thursday didn't look up, didn't notice as we flowed by, and I think now that maybe they couldn't see us at all. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">We ended up at a door.  Just a regular door, set into a brick wall between two dark storefronts with the metal grates down.  I tried to get any kind of bearings, but my knowledge of the city was limited to the apartment building we lived in and the few blocks surrounding it.  Oh, and the museums.  I knew where all the museums were.  But this door wasn't near anything familiar, and the tooth fairy still had his long fingers wrapped around my hand like a vice.
        	Inside were stairs.  Everything was colder, an all-over cold, and I didn't like it.  We went down.  I remember it being damp.  My socks stuck to my feet.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The tooth fairy's downstairs was a big place.  Too big for me to see much of it, really.  There was an open hall where we came out, and in the walls there were doors everywhere and some of them were open and through those doors were more hallways and more dark.  The main hall, though, was lit up.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">There were tables.  Lots and lots of tables.  Long, and silvery, made of some kind of shiny metal.  The floor was shiny too; I think it was marble.  And it was full of them.  Things like the tooth fairy, I mean.</p> 

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">They lined the tables, dozens upon dozens of slender figures with long, pale fingers and a thousand flashing teeth.  There was an odd smell in the air, a sour woodsy musk, and heady; my small lungs were no match for it and within a few moments I was blinking dizziness out. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Look close,' the tooth fairy said then, the first words he'd spoken since we'd left my room.  'This is an Underground, boychild, and few of your kind ever see such things.' So I looked close.  The things at the tables were paying no attention to us.  They were busy, see.  The tables were busy too, holding up all the people.
        	When I made a noise, the tooth fairy touched one spindly finger to my lips and my voice went away along with my breath.  </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Choking, I stared past the hunching fairy-things to the prone bodies of thirty or forty children.  They were dirty, straggly hair tucked beneath their torn clothing.  Everything about them was turned off and still, sort of waxy, and I thought they might be dead except for that they were breathing and I could see it and that was awful.  I could only find one head, and even then only barely; they had this girl's mouth open and there were three figures bending over to work around inside it. She was far away, but I thought maybe she was crying.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">The tooth fairy let me breathe again after only a second or two.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Your Upperground is so careless with its young,' he mused.  'It's hard to imagine a species with such low regard for itself; we pluck these straight off your streets.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I had no idea what this meant, and was too caught up in being petrified to really care. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'This is for overflow, in case you were wondering.'  Not letting go of my hand, each of my fingers enclosed in the icy circle of his, the tooth fairy used his other hand to wave at the tables.  'You demand and demand, and we... Well, we supply.  But we can only do so much, boychild, without taking a little... initiative.'  He emphasized each pause with a new twist of the lips, and because of the way his skin stretched across his face this was a horrid thing to watch. I thought of an accident I'd seen on television, where a man in a car hit another car and a piece of metal sheared through his cheek, pulling the skin with it.</p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt"><em>At the preschool, I wait for Sarah Masters to climb into the back of my car.  Her parents, who are my relatives by marriage and therefore trust me to do this for them, are paying me $100 per week to ferry their ray of sunshine back and forth.  I do it for the spending money and because it gives me an excellent excuse to frequent all the places that little children love. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Sarah shows up.  She has blond pigtails, and a woman with a red shirt helps her into the special seat.  I start the engine.</em></p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Are you hurting them?'  I asked. It was a stupid question.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'Hurting them, hurting them,' the tooth fairy repeated.  'It's all relative, really, boychild, they would have starved eventually.  Do you know why I brought you here?  No, of course not.' He bent to my level and pointed at my chest.  I looked at him, suddenly unable even to cry.  'I brought you here, boychild, because you have a little shine inside you, something we look for.  There are secrets in your family, do you know that?  Secrets go back many generations and this one is no different; I would wager your parents haven't a clue what's in their blood and do you know something else, boychild?  They never will.  Because you will cry and you will scream and you will tell them all, and they will never, ever believe you.  And then, many thens from now, you will be all grown and that secret will come home.  It will come to you in the night, as I did, because you saw the true trade - the fingernails, you recall - and you saw me, and that means one day this Underground will be your Underground too.  You'd best prepare, boychild; we always need more workers.'</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">He put a finger on my chin and pointed my face towards the nearest table, where a teenaged boy was thrashing under two sets of long, long fingers. A tooth fairy yanked, spattering red and infected yellow onto the floor, and the boy went limp.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">'See?'</p>
        	
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I shut my eyes tight, the musky air making my stomach spin and roil, my hand nearly numb with cold and pain.
        	When I opened them again, I was home in my bed, the submarine-shaped flashlight pressed up against my chin from where I'd been lying on it.  The window was closed.  I was alone.</p>
 
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt"><em>Before I drop Sarah off at home, I swing her by the playground.  I take my notepad and my pencils and go to sit on one of the benches near the swings.  This place is a mess of kids, really; if I were actually trying to watch Sarah's every move I'd have a hell of a time.  But I'm not all that interested in her.  I'm not really interested in any of these little fuckers, to be honest.  My eyes are on the fringe players, the children who look a little thinner, a little more wary of joining the throng.  It's hard to tell if they're homeless, of course, until you follow them a bit.  That's what the pad is for: I like to write down little notes, in case I see them begging around later.</p>
        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">I move to scratch an itch inside my left shoe, and my knee knocks against the box.  I hadn't realized I'd brought it along.  I laugh.  Silly me.  I look around, just checking, but there's no one near my bench.  All the other parents are over by the jungle gym, where the pack is really thick.  I go ahead and humor myself, opening the box.  I've almost got a whole set now.  It's exciting; I have to keep myself from opening it at all sorts of inappropriate times.  Like now.  But I've been good today; I can give myself this little guilty pleasure.</p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Fifteen years ago, the tooth fairy took me Underground.  He told me there was a secret, and that someday I'd go Underground again.  It took me a long, long time to figure it out.  But I was clever enough in the end, and now it's almost time.  I only need two more and I'll be done, and then... I can find him again.  I can show him my collection.  They're all fresh.  They'll be good enough to trade, I'm sure of it.  And then I won't have to go back, do you see?  I won't have to do the work anymore, not with them, not with the things at the tables. </p>

        	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:36pt">Maybe then I'll finally get some sleep.</em></p>

								<p><em><strong>after</strong></em><br>

									i am like wood, i think<br>

in the sense that i've been splintered<br>

fractures in me opened where you used to be<br>

i try to fix it, pressing stump to stump<br>

and wincing as your absence snakes beneath my fingernails:<br>

slivers of longing too thin to catch out<br>

so they'll stay here and fester<br>

pieces of the self i should be, the whole self,<br>

once you've glued me back together?<br>

they haunt me with little pains<br>

the kind you can forget for a while<br>

before you put pressure on the wrong spot and suddenly<br>

it's all you own</p>

<hr style="height: 2px; color: #000000; width: 50%"></hr>
<p><em><strong>Character Study</strong></em><br>
	The way you move reminds me<br>
of a cat, tired or hungry and<br>
certainly bigger than the streetlights would have me believe.<br>
I have heard that strays can be domesticated--<br>
if you are not too obvious--<br>
but I'm afraid you might mistake my face for plastic<br>
and insist on someone else's late-night scraps.<br></p>
<hr style="height: 2px; color: #000000; width: 50%"></hr>
<p><em><strong>Plans</strong></em><br>
I believe I may take up smoking.<br>
I hear it brings about a change of state,<br>
and I may like to be the kind of person<br>
who can breathe nicotine<br>
instead of an answer.<br>
I've tried my hand at picking locks,<br>
without great success.<br>
I think this is because of the way<br>
I am not sharp,<br>
the fingers of my thoughts too rounded by<br>
inconsistency and indecision.<br>
This could be helped with the use of a lighter,<br>
the spark of the cigarette smoldering away until<br>
I am all in points <br>
and in ash.<br></p>
<hr style="height: 2px; color: #000000; width: 50%"></hr>
<p><em><strong>Writer's Block</strong></em><br>
I can feel them all through me<br>
like secrets or like<br>
the hairs on the backs of my arms<br>
very present yet very<br>
near to invisible.<br>
It's like mud<br>
thick and viscous<br>
collecting against the insides of my bones<br>
pressing cold against each<br>
loud pulse of blood and<br>
impossible to release.<br>
They're everywhere here,<br>
the living stain,<br>
waiting and wanting and shut up in me<br>
without tongues or eyes or<br>
small noisy lips.<br>
I can't let them out<br>
somehow<br>
can't put my fingertips against some white thing<br>
and leave a print<br>
a mark<br>
a word.<br></p>
